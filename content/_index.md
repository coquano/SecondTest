        I first worked in the group of Bruno Machet in LPTHE (Laboratoire de Physique Th√©orique des Hautes √ânergies, Sorbonne
        Universit√©, Paris, France) for a couple of months.

        Then, I joined the team of Dominique Mouhanna in LPTMC (Laboratoire de Physique Th√©orique de la Mati√®re Condens√©e,
        Sorbonne Universit√©, Paris, France). During this time, I had the chance to collaborate with Sofian Teber from LPTHE (Paris).

        I have been working for three years in the group of Matthias Sperl (Institut f√ºr Materialphysik im Weltraum,
        Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt, K√∂ln, Germany).

        Before coming to Perpignan, I have worked for one year in the group of Ludovic Berthier in L2C (Laboratoire Charles Coulomb,
        Universit√© de Montpellier, Montpellier, France).

        My research interest concentrate on systems that can be considered as holding an intermediate position
        between the two ideal models of the crystalline solid and the simple liquid.
        
        This include for example the study of deformation of crystalline membrane, which, because of their bidemensional character
        present much stronger thermal fluctuations as usual three dimensional solids, and therefore display unconventional elasticity.

        I have also been working on the determination of the structural and rheological properties of complex fluids (that typically
        display non Newtonian rules of flow).

        A quite substantial part of my work has been devoted to the study of the flow properties of granular liquids. These
        systems, despite their ubiquitous character are still poorly understood today because, on the formal level, they escape
        the rules at the basis of the well-known frameworks in statistical physics (the granular particles being dissipative,
        granular flows are always in an out-of-equilibrium state when they are not at rest).

        In order to study these systems, I use a wide combination of tools, mostly from statistical field theory and the renormalisation
        group on the one end (using both perturbative and non perturbative schemes), but also mode-coupling theory
